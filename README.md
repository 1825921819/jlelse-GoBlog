# GoBlog

Hello!

This repository contains the code for GoBlog, my own blogging system. I created it because I was tired of all the workarounds to customize Hugo and other blog systems to my needs.

The goals of GoBlog are:

- Minimalism
- Flexibility
- (IndieWeb)

Documentation on how to use GoBlog yourself will follow soon.
