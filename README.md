# GoBlog

Hello!

This repository contains the code for GoBlog, my own blogging system. I created it because I was tired of all the workarounds to customize Hugo and other blog systems to my needs.

The goals of GoBlog are:

- Minimalism
- Performance
- Flexibility
- IndieWeb

To configure GoBlog, take a look at the `example-config.yml` file and save your configuration to `config\config.yml`.

Administration paths:

- Login: `/login`
- Logout: `/logout`
- Editor: `/editor` (prefixed with the blog path)
- Notifications: `/notifications`
- Webmentions: `/webmention`
- Comments: `/comment`

More detailed documentation on how to use GoBlog yourself will follow soon.
