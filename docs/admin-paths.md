# Administration paths

Most settings can be adjusted via the configuration. But to create new posts, log in or out, see notifications or check webmentions there are fixed (partly configurable) paths:

- Login: `/login`
- Logout: `/logout`
- Notifications: `/notifications`
- Webmentions: `/webmention`
- Comments: `/comment`

Some paths are blog-relative, so they must be appended to the blog path:

- Editor: `/editor`
